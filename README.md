# Fast-Food-Restaurant-Menu-Recommendation-System
This repository contains a code for a program that recommends a fast food restaurant's menu, including specific menu data, by receiving conditions for price, calories, and discount information from users through the interface. I uploaded the sql code that manages the database and the python code that operates the program.
